## Enhancing the Panagram Frontend: A Community Challenge

Congratulations on reaching this stage! We've successfully set up the "Panagram" word-guessing game, which you can see running locally. While functional, the current user interface (UI) is admittedly quite basic.

This presents a fantastic opportunity for you to flex your frontend development skills. We encourage you to take the existing Panagram application and "clean this up and make it look pretty." If you develop an improved UI, please share your work by tagging **@kierinightingal** on Twitter (note the spelling: "Nightingale" with an "e" wouldn't fit, so it's "gal").

For transparency, the current rudimentary frontend was built using **Tailwind CSS**. Interestingly, **ChatGPT** was utilized to assist with the initial styling; the existing code was provided to the AI with the prompt to "make this pretty for me" using Tailwind. We are genuinely excited to see the beautiful and intuitive frontend designs you can create for Panagram.

## Introducing the Final Project: Building an ETH Currency Mixer

Now, let's turn our attention to the final, capstone project of this course: we're going to build a currency mixer, specifically an **ETH (Ethereum) mixer**.

The core concept behind this mixer is to **break the flow of funds from the depositor to the withdrawer**. In essence, it aims to enhance transaction privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. For those familiar with the Web3 space, the functionality we'll be exploring is similar to "what Tornado Cash did." Our project, however, will be named "Mixer."

It is crucial to understand and emphasize that this project is undertaken for **educational purposes only**. We will be exploring the technical mechanisms and cryptographic principles behind such systems. The development of this Mixer will likely involve concepts such as smart contracts (as suggested by tools like Foundry) and potentially zero-knowledge proofs (hinted at by Noir documentation), which are fundamental to building robust privacy-enhancing applications.

In the next section, we will begin the process of constructing this ETH currency mixer.
