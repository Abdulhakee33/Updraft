## Getting Started with Functions in Rust

Functions are fundamental building blocks in Rust, allowing you to encapsulate logic, promote code reuse, and structure your programs effectively. This lesson provides a comprehensive introduction to defining, calling, and understanding the nuances of functions in Rust.

## Declaring Functions in Rust

In Rust, functions are declared using the `fn` keyword. The basic syntax involves the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and an optional return type.

**Syntax:**

```rust
fn function_name(param1: Type1, param2: Type2) -> ReturnType {
    // function body: statements and/or expressions
}
```

Let's illustrate this with a simple example. We'll create a function named `add` that takes two unsigned 32-bit integers (`u32`) as input and returns their sum, also as a `u32`.

```rust
fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    return x + y;
}
```

Let's break down this `add` function:
*   `fn add`: This declares a function named `add`.
*   `(x: u32, y: u32)`: This defines two parameters: `x` of type `u32`, and `y` also of type `u32`. Type annotations for parameters are mandatory in Rust.
*   `-> u32`: This specifies that the function `add` will return a value of type `u32`.
*   `{ return x + y; }`: This is the function body. Here, `x + y` calculates the sum, and the `return` keyword explicitly sends this sum back to the caller. Note the semicolon at the end of the `return` statement.

## Mastering Return Values

Rust offers flexibility in how functions return values. You can use an explicit `return` statement or leverage Rust's expression-based nature for implicit returns.

### Explicit Return

As seen in our initial `add` function, the `return` keyword explicitly designates the value to be returned. A semicolon must follow the `return` statement.

For clarity, let's rename our first version of `add` to `add_with_return`:

```rust
fn add_with_return(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    return x + y;
}
```

### Implicit Return

Rust is an expression-based language, which means most things evaluate to a value. If the last line of a function body is an expression (without a trailing semicolon), its value is automatically returned. The `return` keyword is not needed in this case.

Let's refactor our `add` function to use an implicit return:

```rust
fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    x + y // No semicolon; this expression's value is returned
}
```

**Important Note:** Only the *final expression* in a function block can be an implicit return. Any preceding lines of code within the function must be statements, typically ending with a semicolon.

Consider this modified `add` function:

```rust
fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    println!("Calculating sum for x = {}", x); // This is a statement
    println!("And y = {}", y);                 // This is also a statement
    x + y                                     // This is an expression, its value is returned
}
```
Here, the `println!` macro calls are statements (they perform an action but don't evaluate to the value we want to return from `add`). The final line `x + y` is an expression, and its result becomes the return value of the `add` function.

### Returning Multiple Values

Functions in Rust can return multiple values by using a tuple as the return type. A tuple is a collection of values of different types, grouped together.

Let's modify our `add` function to return both the sum (a `u32`) and a boolean flag (`bool`):

```rust
fn add_multiple(x: u32, y: u32) -> (u32, bool) {
    return (x + y, true); // Returns a tuple containing the sum and 'true'
}
```
The return type `-> (u32, bool)` indicates that the function will return a tuple where the first element is a `u32` and the second is a `bool`.

### Functions Without Explicit Returns (The Unit Type)

If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns the "unit type," denoted as `()`. The unit type is an empty tuple and essentially signifies "no meaningful value." You can omit `-> ()` from the function signature if it doesn't return anything.

Here's an example of a `print_message` function that takes a `String` and prints it to the console. It performs an action but doesn't return any specific data.

```rust
fn print_message(s: String) { // Implicitly returns ()
    // In Rust 2021 edition and later, "{s}" uses s as an implicit named argument.
    // This line prints the content of the string 's' five times, concatenated.
    println!("{s}{s}{s}{s}{s}");
}
```

## Understanding Function Parameters

Parameters are the inputs to your functions. They are defined within the parentheses after the function name, with each parameter specified as `name: Type`. Type annotations for all function parameters are mandatory.

### Type Conversion for Arguments

When calling a function, the arguments you pass must match the types of the parameters defined in the function signature. Sometimes, this requires explicit type conversion.

Our `print_message` function, for example, expects a parameter `s` of type `String`. However, string literals in Rust (e.g., `"üê∏"`) are of type `&str` (a string slice, which is a reference to string data).

To pass a string literal like `"üê∏"` to `print_message`, we must convert it from `&str` to `String`. A common way to do this is by using the `.to_string()` method:

```rust
// Assuming print_message function is defined as above
// print_message("üê∏"); // This would cause a type error

print_message("üê∏".to_string()); // Correct: "üê∏" (&str) is converted to String
```
The distinction between `String` (an owned, heap-allocated string) and `&str` (a string slice) is a key concept in Rust's ownership system, which will be explored in more detail in future lessons.

## Calling Functions

Once a function is defined, you can call (or invoke) it by using its name followed by parentheses. If the function expects arguments, you provide them inside the parentheses.

If a function returns a value, you can assign this value to a variable using a `let` binding.

Let's see how to call our previously defined functions within a `main` function, which is the entry point for Rust programs.

```rust
// This attribute can be placed at the top of a file
// to suppress compiler warnings for unused code, useful during development.
#![allow(unused)]

fn add(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    x + y
}

fn print_message(s: String) {
    println!("{s}{s}{s}{s}{s}");
}

fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;

    // Calling the 'add' function (which uses implicit return)
    // and storing its result in 'z'.
    let z = add(x, y);
    println!("{} + {} = {}", x, y, z); // Expected output: 1 + 2 = 3

    // Calling the 'print_message' function
    print_message("üê∏".to_string()); // Expected output: üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏üê∏
}
```

## Running Your Rust Code

To compile and run your Rust code, you typically use Cargo, Rust's build system and package manager. If your code is in a file named `func.rs` within an `examples` directory of your Cargo project, you would run it from your terminal using:

```bash
cargo run --example func
```

## Key Takeaways: Rust Functions at a Glance

Let's summarize the core concepts covered in this lesson:

*   **`fn` Keyword:** Used to declare all functions in Rust.
*   **Type Annotations:** Mandatory for function parameters and return values. They ensure type safety.
*   **`return` Keyword:** Can be used for explicit returns. A statement using `return` must end with a semicolon.
*   **Implicit Returns:** If the last line of a function is an expression (no semicolon), its value is automatically returned.
*   **Semicolons:** Differentiate statements (which end with `;`) from expressions (which often don't end with `;` if they are intended as the return value of a block or function).
*   **Tuples:** Used to enable functions to return multiple values.
*   **Unit Type `()`:** The implicit return type of functions that don't explicitly return a value. It signifies "no value."
*   **Common Types:** We encountered `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integer), `bool` (boolean: `true` or `false`), `String` (owned string), and `&str` (string slice).
*   **`.to_string()` Method:** A common method for converting various types, like `&str`, into an owned `String`.
*   **`println!` Macro:** A versatile macro used for printing formatted output to the console.
*   **Rust 2021 Implicit Named Arguments:** In `println!` macros (and other formatting macros), if a variable `s` is in scope, `{s}` can be used as a shorthand for `{s = s}`. This is why `println!("{s}{s}{s}{s}{s}");` effectively prints the content of the variable `s` five times.
*   **`#![allow(unused)]`:** A crate-level attribute useful during development to suppress compiler warnings about unused code, variables, or functions.

Understanding functions is crucial for writing any non-trivial Rust program. By mastering their declaration, parameter handling, and return value mechanics, you'll be well-equipped to build robust and maintainable applications.
